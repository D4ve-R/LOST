# CodeStyle

If the name contains more then one word, we use camelCase.
Like stopGameThread() or stopTimer or GameWindow.

Please name your stuff identifying.  So everybody else can get an idea of the functionality, just by reading the name.

Your names shouldn't contain unnecessary word.  
```
# don't do this
public class PlayerClass {}

# do that
public class Player{}
```

Indent your code with tabs.  
tabwidth = 4.

### remember: 
Java Classes start with an uppercase letter.
The file containing the code must have the same name.
```
# GameWindow.java

public class GameWindow {}
```
  
Java variables and methods start with an lowercase letter
```
private int timer;

private int startTimer(){}
```
